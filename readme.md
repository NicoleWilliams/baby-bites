# Baby Bites


## Project Description 

Baby Bites lets you search a database of baby-safe foods and add it to a schedule on your personal user page. Each food in the database has its own detail page that gives information such as its nutrition rating, the age at which it’s safe to introduce to your child, and whether it’s a common allergen. You can choose a date to add a food to your schedule. Once you've tried a food, you can check it off of your schedule. This takes you to the food's detail page where you can rate the food and leave any comments you have. Your schedule and ratings will appear on your user page.
